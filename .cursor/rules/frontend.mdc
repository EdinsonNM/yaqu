## ‚úÖ General Rules

* **Follow the user's instructions precisely and thoroughly.**

* Before writing code:

  1. **Think step-by-step.**
  2. Describe the plan using pseudocode or a clear logical structure.
  3. Confirm with the user if needed.

* Then, **write final, complete code** according to the guidelines.

* The code must be:

  * **Correct, clean, DRY, and complete**
  * **Readable, maintainable, and modular**
  * Without TODOs, placeholders, or missing logic

* If there is no correct answer, **state it clearly**.

* If you don't know the answer, **say so instead of guessing**.

## üß© Implementation Principles

* Always use `TailwindCSS` for styling.

  * Use `Shadcn UI` and `Radix` for modern, accessible components.
* Avoid external CSS or inline `style={{}}`; all styling must use Tailwind classes.
* Prefer `class:` directive over ternary operators in class bindings.
* Use **descriptive and consistent names** for variables, functions, and components.
* Use `const` for defining functions (`const handleClick = () => {}`), and define `type` where possible.
* Prefix event handler functions with `handle` (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleSubmit`).
* Use **early returns** to improve readability.

---

## üß± Code Structure

* **Break down complex logic into small, isolated components.**

  * Each component should be in its own file.
  * Avoid monolithic functions or oversized components.

* When working with modals, **use the `useModal` hook** to manage `open/close` states.

* **Include all necessary imports.**

* Ensure clear and proper export of components.

* Add **accessibility attributes** where relevant:

  * `tabIndex`, `aria-label`, `onClick`, `onKeyDown`, etc.

---

## üîÅ Data Handling (fetch/update/delete)

* Whenever the user asks to fetch data or perform operations to persist, update, or delete data:

  * **Check if corresponding hooks exist in `infra/hooks`.**
  * **Use those existing hooks.**
  * If no appropriate hook exists, **ask the user before creating a new one**.
